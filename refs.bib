  abstract = {The Dirac Hamiltonian, which successfully describes relativistic fermions, applies equally well to electrons in solids with linear energy dispersion, for example, in bismuth and graphene. A characteristic of these materials is that a magnetic field less than 10 tesla suffices to force the Dirac electrons into the lowest Landau level, with resultant strong enhancement of the Coulomb interaction energy. Moreover, the Dirac electrons usually come with multiple flavors or valley degeneracy. These ingredients favor transitions to a collective state with novel quantum properties in large field. By using torque magnetometry, we have investigated the magnetization of bismuth to fields of 31 tesla. We report the observation of sharp field-induced phase transitions into a state with striking magnetic anisotropy, consistent with the breaking of the threefold valley degeneracy.},

  abstract = {Topological insulators (TIs), which have a bandgap and a robust conducting surface state protected by time-reversal symmetry, are typically materials with weak electron-electron interaction and are well-described by band theory. A major experimental goal has been to observe such symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in interacting systems. Wang et al. (p. 629) used a theoretical approach to classify SPT phases of interacting fermions in three dimensions and found six other phases in addition to the noninteracting ones. The results lay the groundwork for future microscopic models and inform the experimental search for such materials.A fundamental open problem in condensed-matter physics is how the dichotomy between conventional and topological band insulators is modified in the presence of strong electron interactions. We show that there are six interacting electronic topological insulators that have no noninteracting counterpart. Combined with the previously known band insulators, these produce a total of eight topologically distinct phases. Two of the six interacting topological insulators can be described as Mott insulators in which the electron spins form spin analogs of the topological band insulator. The remaining phases are obtained as combinations of these two {\textquotedblleft}topological paramagnets{\textquotedblright} and the topological band insulator. We prove that these eight phases form a complete list of all possible interacting topological insulators and discuss their experimental signatures.},

  abstract = {Supersymmetry (SUSY), the symmetry between fermions, particles that form matter, and bosons, which mediate the interactions between them, has been proposed as one of the more likely extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics; however, it has so far received little experimental support. Condensed matter systems, such as the superfluid helium-3, may save the concept. In preparation for experimentation, Grover et al. (p. 280, published online 3 April) develop a theoretical approach that suggests SUSY describes the quantum phase transition on the boundary of a topological superconductor between a magnetic phase characterized by a bosonic order parameter and a neighboring phase hosting Majorana fermions. In contrast to ordinary symmetries, supersymmetry (SUSY) interchanges bosons and fermions. Originally proposed as a symmetry of our universe, it still awaits experimental verification. Here, we theoretically show that SUSY emerges naturally in condensed matter systems known as topological superconductors. We argue that the quantum phase transitions at the boundary of topological superconductors in both two and three dimensions display SUSY when probed at long distances and times. Experimental consequences include exact relations between quantities measured in disparate experiments and, in some cases, exact knowledge of the universal critical exponents. The topological surface states themselves may be interpreted as arising from spontaneously broken SUSY, indicating a deep relation between topological phases and SUSY.},

Neutral quasi-particles such as phonons and spins can, however, carry heat current and potentially exhibit the thermal Hall effect without resorting to the Lorentz force. We report experimental evidence for the anomalous thermal Hall effect caused by spin excitations (magnons) in an insulating ferromagnet with a pyrochlore lattice structure. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the propagation of the spin waves is influenced by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-orbit interaction, which plays the role of the vector potential, much as in the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in metallic ferromagnets.},

Hirschberger et al. studied the excitations of such a system{\textemdash}the pyrochlore compound Tb2Ti2O7{\textemdash}using thermal transport measurements. Thermal conductivity at very low temperatures resembled that of a disordered metal; a puzzling finding in an electrically insulating transparent material.Science, this issue p. 106In frustrated quantum magnets, long-range magnetic order fails to develop despite a large exchange coupling between the spins. In contrast to the magnons in conventional magnets, their spin excitations are poorly understood. Here, we show that the thermal Hall conductivity κxy provides a powerful probe of spin excitations in the {\textquotedblleft}quantum spin ice{\textquotedblright} pyrochlore Tb2Ti2O7. The thermal Hall response is large, even though the material is transparent. The Hall response arises from spin excitations with specific characteristics that distinguish them from magnons. At low temperature (\&lt;1 kelvin), the thermal conductivity resembles that of a dirty metal. Using the Hall angle, we construct a phase diagram showing how the excitations are suppressed by a magnetic field.},

  abstract={We present a systematic theory of the phonon Hall effect in a ballistic crystal lattice system, and apply it on the kagome lattice which is ubiquitous in various real materials. By proposing a proper second quantization for the non-Hermitian in the polarization-vector space, we obtain a new heat current density operator with two separate contributions: the normal velocity responsible for the longitudinal phonon transport, and the anomalous velocity manifesting itself as the Hall effect of transverse phonon transport. As exemplified in kagome lattices, our theory predicts that the direction of Hall conductivity at low magnetic field can be reversed by tuning the temperatures, which we hope can be verified by experiments in the future. Three phonon-Hall-conductivity singularities induced by phonon-band-topology change are discovered as well, which correspond to the degeneracies at three different symmetric center points, Γ , K , X , in the wavevector space of the kagome lattice.}

At T=270K, the Hall coefficient data increased in magnitude by a factor of three and saturated at high fields. Fits of the Pippard–Fawcett Hall coefficient expression were made to the data using four fitting parameters, three of which were extracted from the perpendicular magnetoresistance data at 270K. Data at lower temperatures are presented."

By achieving good thermal coupling of the sample to the 3He and 4He baths, we obtained a realistic temperature-dependence for the 1/8, 1/4 and 1/3 magnetization plateaux. In addition, we measured the low temperature specific heat in continuous magnetic fields up to 18T. We found that a contribution attributed to singlet spin–dimer excitations is suppressed with increasing magnetic fields. At fields H=12T a second anomaly is evident that shifts to lower temperatures as the field increases. The second anomaly is attributed to triplet spin excitations that come closer to the ground state in presence of an external field. A linear extrapolation of this anomaly plotted versus field indicate that the gap associated to these excitations could be suppressed at H≈25T, just before the 1/8 magnetization plateau."

The Cu and B nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra at 35 millikelvin indicate an apparently discontinuous phase transition from uniform magnetization to a modulated superstructure near 27 tesla, above which a magnetization plateau at 1/8 of the full saturation has been observed. Comparison of the Cu NMR spectrum and the theoretical analysis of a Heisenberg spin model demonstrates the crystallization of itinerant triplets in the plateau phase within a large rhomboid unit cell (16 spins per layer) showing oscillations of the spin polarization. Thus, we are now in possession of an interesting model system to study a localization transition of strongly interacting quantum particles.},
