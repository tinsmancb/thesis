\chapter{The Thermal Hall Effect}


\section{Thermal Hall Conductivity in General}

The thermal Hall effect is the thermal analogue of the much more well
known (electrical) Hall effect. As the Hall effect can be understood as
generalizing the electrical conductivity \(\sigma\) to a tensor in Ohm's
law:
\[\mathbf{j} = \sigma \mathbf{E} \Rightarrow \begin{pmatrix} j_x \\ j_y
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \sigma_{xx} & \sigma_{xy} \\ -\sigma_{xy} &
\sigma_{yy} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} E_x \\ E_y \end{pmatrix} \]
The thermal Hall effect generalizes the thermal conductivity \(\kappa\)
to a tensor in Fourier's law:
\[\mathbf{q} = -\kappa \nabla u \Rightarrow \begin{pmatrix} q_x \\ q_y
\end{pmatrix} = -\begin{pmatrix} \kappa_{xx} & \kappa_{xy} \\ -\kappa_{xy} &
\kappa_{yy} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \partial_x u \\ \partial_y u
\end{pmatrix} \] where \(u\) is the temperature field. Before discussing
the origin of of the thermal Hall conductivity \(\kappa_{xy}\), we
should establish how heat flows through such a material. Let's assume we
have an isotropic material (i.e. \(\kappa_{xx} = \kappa_{xy}\)). The
conductivity tensor can be rewritten as
\[\begin{pmatrix} \kappa_{xx} & \kappa_{xy} \\ -\kappa_{xy} & \kappa_{xx}
\end{pmatrix} = \kappa_{xx} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \kappa_{xy}/\kappa_{xx} \\
-\kappa_{xy}/\kappa_{xx} & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \kappa_{xx} \begin{pmatrix} 1 &
\tan \theta_H \\ -\tan \theta_H & 1 \end{pmatrix} \] where
\(\theta_H = \arctan \kappa_{xy}/\kappa_{xx}\) is the definition of the
thermal Hall angle. Writing down the Heat equation, and splitting the
conductivity into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts:
\begin{align*} -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = c \rho \partial_t u = \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla u) &=
\nabla \cdot (\kappa_{xx}(\mathbb{I} + \kappa_{\mathrm{antisym}}) \nabla u) \\
&= \kappa_{xx}\nabla^2 u + \kappa_{xx}\nabla \cdot (\kappa_{\mathrm{antisym}}
\nabla u) \end{align*} where c is the heat capacity and \(\rho\) is the
mass density. Writing out the \(\kappa_\mathrm{antisym}\) term
explicitly:
\begin{align*}\begin{pmatrix} \partial_x & \partial_y \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \tan
\theta_H \\ -\tan \theta_H & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \partial_x u \\
\partial_y u \end{pmatrix} &= \begin{pmatrix} \partial_x & \partial_y
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \tan \theta_H \partial_x u \\ -\tan \theta_H
\partial_y u \end{pmatrix} \\ &= \tan \theta_H \partial_{xy} u - \tan \theta_H
\partial_{xy} u = 0\end{align*} Thus the equation reduces to the
isotropic heat equation,
\(c\rho \partial_t u = \kappa_{xx} \nabla^2 u\)! Thus, it might seem
like the thermal Hall conductivity would have no effect on the flow of
heat through the material. Indeed, when studying the heat equation, the
conductivity tensor \(\kappa\) is usually assumed to be symmetric.
However, if we impose the Neumann boundary condition
\(g = -\hat{n} \cdot \mathbf{q}\) for some known function \(g\), the
effect of the thermal Hall conductivity can be seen:
\begin{align*}-\hat{n} \cdot \mathbf{q} &= \hat{n} \cdot \kappa \nabla u \\
&= \kappa_{xx} \begin{pmatrix} n_x & n_y \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \tan
\theta_H \\ -\tan \theta_H & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \partial_x u \\
\partial_y u \end{pmatrix} \\ &= \kappa_{xx} \begin{pmatrix} n_x & n_y
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \partial_x u + \tan \theta_H \partial_y u \\
-\tan \theta_H \partial_x u + \partial_y u \end{pmatrix} \\ &= \kappa_{xx} n_x
(\partial_x u + \tan \theta_H \partial_y u) + \kappa_{xx} n_y (-\tan \theta_H
\partial_x u + \partial_y u)  \end{align*} Taking for example
\(\hat{n} = (1, 0)\) and \(g = 0\) (perfectly insulating boundary
conditions):
\[ 0 = - \hat{n} \cdot \mathbf{q} = \kappa_{xx} (\partial_x u + \tan \theta_H
\partial_y u) \Rightarrow \partial_x u = -\tan \theta_H \partial_y u\]
In general, the derivative normal to the boundary is specified in terms
of the transverse derivative and the thermal Hall angle.

In order to see what this kind of boundary condition does in practice,
we can simulate a material with a thermal Hall coefficent using the
finite element method. For simplicity, we will look first at steady
state solutions (i.e.~those with \(\partial_t u = 0\)). Thus we will
need to solve the elliptic partial differential equation
\(-\nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla u) = 0\). We start by expressing this
equation in weak form by multiplying it by a test function \(v\) and
integrating over the function's domain \(\Omega\):
\[ -\nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla u) = 0 \Rightarrow -\int_\Omega \nabla \cdot
(\kappa \nabla u) v dx = 0 \] The function \(u(x,y)\) is said to solve
the weak problem if this equation holds for all functions \(v(x,y)\),
where \(v(x, y) = 0\) anywhere we have specified \(u\) on the boundary
(i.e.~imposed Dirichlet boundary conditions). By integrating by parts,
this becomes:
\[ - \int_\Omega \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla u) v dx = \int_\Omega \kappa \nabla
u \cdot \nabla v dx - \int_{\partial \Omega} (\hat{n} \cdot \kappa\nabla u) v ds\]
where the second integral on the right hand side is over the boundary of
\(\Omega\). The second integral can be rewritten in terms of the Neumann
boundary condition:
\[ - \int_{\partial\Omega} (\hat{n} \cdot \kappa \nabla u) v ds =
\int_{\partial\Omega} g v ds\] and so we have cast the problem in a form
suitable for solving with the finite element method, in terms of the
bilinear form
\[ a(u, v) = \int_\Omega \kappa \nabla u \cdot \nabla v dx \] and the
linear form \[ L(v) = -\int_{\partial \Omega} g v ds \] as
\(a(u, v) = L(v)\). By discretizing the problem using standard methods
over a suitable mesh, the problem reduces to solving a linear system.
There are many references which go into detail on finite element
analysis, but I used \cite{LangtangenLogg2017} which covered the
specific Python library I used to run the following simulations.

\section{Thermometry}

Temperature is generally understood to be a measure of the average
kinetic energy contained in the atoms, electrons, and phonons (or other
quasiparticle excitations) which make up matter. Within the formalism of
statistical mechanics, we can compute compute the temperature within the
microcanonical ensemble as function of the total energy \(E\) and
information about the states of the system:
\[\frac{1}{T} = \frac{dS}{dE} = \frac{d}{dE} k \log W\] where \(W(E)dE\)
is the number of states with energy between \(E\) and \(E+dE\) and \(k\)
is Boltzmann's constant. This function, however, can only be computed
explicity for the simplest physical systems. In practice, if we want to
study the flow of heat through a system by measuring temperature, we
must find some other observable we can measure as a proxy.

In principle, we might want to find some system whose thermodynamic
equation of state depends on temperature and other quantities which are
all independant of temperature. Such a system is refered to as a primary
thermometer. For a simple example of such a thermometer, consider the
equation of state of an ideal gas: \[PV = NkT\] If we take a sample of
an ideal gas with a known number of molecules \(N\) in a known volume
\(V\), we can determine the temperature \(T\) by measuring its pressure
\(P\). Other examples of primary thermometers include measurements of
the speed of sound in a gas, measurements of the Johnson-Nyquist noise
in an electrical circuit, or measurements of blackbody radiation
\cite{Ekin2006}. These methods of measuring temperature are very useful
for accurately setting a temperature scale, but they have some serious
drawbacks as thermometers for use in other experiments. Most of them
require sensitive measurements of multiple physical observables, as well
as bulky and complicated experimental apparatus. If one wanted to
determine the thermal conductivity of a small crystal by measuring a
temperature gradient across its length, it would not be feasable to
connect the crystal to two independant samples of an ideal gas and
measure their pressures. Thus, the temperature standard set by these
methods must be transferred to a more convenient thermometer.

Such a device is known as a secondary thermometer. In this case, we
measure some observable as a function of temperature, which we determine
from some known standard. This can be a primary thermometer or another
secondary thermometer which has already been calibrated to sufficient
accuracy. In experimental condensed matter physics, by far the most
common types of secondary thermometers used are resistance thermometers
and thermocouples. Resistance thermometers simply measure the resistance
of some material as a proxy for temperature, either a metal such as
platinum (resistance increasing with higher temperature, or ``positive
temperature coefficent'') or a semiconductor, such as
zirconium--oxynitride (known by its trademarked name Cernox) or
ruthenium oxide (resistance decreasing with higher temperature, or
``negative temperature coefficent''). Such thermometers are convenient
since they can be made compact, they are commercially available, and
there are well--established protocols and instrumentation for measuring
resistance. There are a wide variety of resistance thermometers that
suit different temperature ranges and experimental conditions.
Thermocouples, which measure the temperature dependant thermopower
between two metals with differing carrier concentrations, can be even
more compact and are especially useful for making differential
measurements. However, they require measurments of DC voltages in the
microvolt range, and their sensitivy is reduced at low temperature. In
any case, both of these methods allow us to measure temperature without
considering the microscopic details of the system, only how accurately
it has been calibrated.

There are some experimental details which must be considered when using
a resistance thermometer. Many important experimental techniques in
condensed matter physics involve applying an intense magnetic field (up
to 45T for the current state-of-the-art DC magnets) to a sample of
interest. Resistance thermometers generally exhibit magnetoresistance,
the changing of their resistivity in a magnetic field. The most commonly
used resistance thermometers are selected to have as small a
magnetoresistnace as possible, but even Cernox thermometers display a
change of resistance of a few percent in magnetic fields up to 14T. If
one is not measuring any direct thermal property of a sample and can
safely assume that the sample is well thermalized with the cold finger,
one can simply mount a thermometer outside the region of intense
magnetic field. However, if you are measuring some thermal propety of a
material (such as heat capacity or thermal conductivity), there is no
getting around calibrating the thermometer as a function of temperature
and magnetic field (see figure \ref{cernox_fieldcal}). For semiconductor
thermometers such as Cernox, the magnetoresistance can vary quite a bit
from thermometer to thermometer, as they can have slightly different
doping levels. Additionally, the magnetoresistance depends in general on
the orientation of the thermometer with respect to the applied magnetic
field. Thus, the thermometer must either be calibrated in situ, or great
care must be taken to ensure that the thermometer's orientation is
preserved from experiment to experiment.

\begin{figure}

thermometer.
\((T_{\mathrm{apparent}} - T_{\mathrm{actual}})/T_{\mathrm{actual}}\) is
plotted versus the actual temperature. \label{cernox_fieldcal}}
\end{figure}

Regardless, there is a great deal of scientific value in thermal
measurments performed in strong magnetic fields. Heat capacity provides
a generic method for identifying phase transitions, and thermal
transport is sensitive to excitations in a solid which do not carry
charge and thus can't be studied with electrical transport methods.
Thus, it is our goal to develop new methods for accurately and precisely
measuring temperature in the presence of intense magnetic fields. The
scientific potential of these methods and the experimental techniques
they make possible will be underscored in the next section. For more
information about thermometry and its application in experimental
condensed matter physics, chapter 5 of \cite{Ekin2006} is an invaluable
reference.

\section{Quantum Criticality in Strontium Titanate}

\section{Strontium Titanate Thermometers}

Thermal transport measurements provide a versatile set of methods for probing
the physical properties of matter. Among thermal transport properties, the
thermal Hall effect shows promise for probing the ground state of many materials
of physical interest.  The thermal Hall effect, also known as the Righi-Leduc
effect,  is a thermal analogue of the standard Hall effect in which a thermal
gradient is applied across a sample in a magnetic field resulting a secondary
orthogonal thermal gradient. In this sense, a thermal Hall conductivity
$\kappa_{xy}$ is analogous to the Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$.  While
$\sigma_{xy}$ in general contains information about the charged excitations
(electrons or holes) in a material, $\kappa_{xy}$ in principle contains
information about all the low-energy excitations. As a result the thermal Hall
effect has been of great theoretical interest for several years. In particular,
there has been some work that indicates that this technique may prove useful for
the study of strongly-correlated topological insulators (TIs) and
high-temperature superconductors. The thermal Hall effect is proposed to reveal
the experimental signature of different kinds of surface states\cite{Wang2014}:
free fermion TIs with a single Dirac cone, and two types of topological
paramagnet with spin-liquid behavior. Traditional Hall effect measurements can
distinguish some of these phases, but specific classification requires
measurement of the thermal Hall conductivity. Further theoretical studies
suggest that the thermal Hall effect could be used to study the quantum phase
transition from an Ising-like state with bosonic excitations to Majorana
fermions in the topological superconductors with supersymmetry~\cite{Grover2014}.

However, despite the intense theoretical interest in the thermal Hall effect,
the technique remains difficult to implement experimentally. A few interesting
measurements have been made in ferromagnets\cite{Onose2010}, frustrated quantum
magnets\cite{Hirschberger2015}, and cuprate superconductors\cite{Cvetkovic2015}, but
the experimental complications of accurately measuring temperature in an intense
magnetic field has prevented the technique from being applied more generally.
Because of the potential value of this technique for studying strongly
correlated materials and other materials of interest, we have sought to devise a
simple method for making these measurements. In particular, we wish to develop a
method which can be used on a wide variety of materials and throughout a large
temperature range, while being independent of the magnetic field.

In order to accomplish this, we have developed thermometers which measure
temperature by measuring the dielectric constant $\epsilon$ of strontium
titanate (SrTiO$_3$). High quality wafers of SrTiO$_3$ are generally available
for purchase, and the material is durable and relatively easy to work with. Its
value as a thermometer comes from the fact that its dielectric constant
increases by up to a few orders of magnitude at low temperature. This comes from
the fact that SrTiO$_3$ is very close to a quantum critical
point\cite{Rowley2014}. Materials similar to SrTiO$_3$, such as Barium Titanate
(BaTiO$_3$), undergo a ferroelectric transition at sufficiently low temperature.
On the other hand, SrTiO$_3$ is classical paraelectric at room temperature, but
is prevented from undergoing a ferroelectric transition due to long-range
interactions suppressing the ferroelectric state, causing it to remain a
(quantum) paraelectric instead. As a result, the dielectric constant does not
diverge a finite temperature, but instead saturates at about 4 K, depending on
the particular sample.

\begin{figure} \caption{A pair of STO thermometers, used to make thermal
  measurements. The background is a piece of graph paper with 1mm divisions, the
thermometers themselves are approximately 0.5 mm long, 0.5 mm wide, and 0.3 mm
thick.} \centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/thermometers_apl.jpg}\label{thermo_pic}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure} \caption{An example calibration curve for an STO thermometer,
  showing both the capacitance (solid) and sensitivity (dashed) as a function of
temperature. The capacitance begins to saturate at low temperature, with the
sensitivity peaking around 25K. } \centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/cvt_apl.eps}\label{cal_curve}
\end{figure}

In order to make a thermometer out of SrTiO$_3$, we take a small, thin (0.1 mm)
sample of the material (purchased from the MTI corporation)\cite{MTICorp} and
evaporate gold contacts on to either face.  These contacts form a parallel-plate
capacitor, and by measuring the change in the capacitance we measure the
dielectric constant and by proxy the temperature.  Figure~\ref{thermo_pic} shows
a pair of assembled thermometers.  The thermometers are approximately 0.5 mm
long, 0.5 mm wide, and 0.3mm thick, and the electrical leads are a pair of 25
$\mu$m diameter phosphor bronze wires.  Figure~\ref{cal_curve} shows an example
calibration curve for an SrTiO$_3$ thermometer. Both the capacitance and
sensitivity of the thermometer are shown from 4 K up to room temperature. The
magnitude of the sensitivity increases (note the sign, increasing dielectric
constant corresponds to decreasing temperature) up to about 25 K before
decreasing and reaching a maximum value below 4 K. The particulars depend
somewhat on the individual thermometer, notably, some do not reach a maximum
value at all above 1.5 K, the lowest temperature at which we calibrated the
thermometers used in this experiment. We believe this to be due to variance in
our process for making the thermometers, in particular the amount of heat they
are exposed to when the leads are attached and the resin surrounding the wafer
is cured. Because of this, they must be calibrated \textit{in situ} for each
experiment.  However, the general trend is the same, with the sensitivity being
greatest around 20 to 40 K. Using our capacitance bridges (an Andeen-Hagerling
2700A digital bridge and a General Radio 1615-A analog bridge), we can reliably
measure a change in capacitance of about 1$\times$10$^{-5}$ pF. This corresponds
to change in temperature of 0.1 mK. Other measurements~\cite{Hirschberger2015}
using resistive thermometers quote a resolution of 0.2 - 0.4 mK. This is after
extensive field calibration of the thermometers, a time-consuming process which
these thermometers eliminate.

\begin{figure} \caption{A test of the response of an STO thermometer to an
    applied magnetic field, taken at 4.2K.  The field starts at zero, scans to
    10T (blue), then to -10T (green), and then back to zero (red).  The relative
    change in the capacitance $(C - C_0)/C_0$ remains less than
  3$\times$10$^{-4}$, corresponding to change of about 20 femtofarads. This
change in capacitance is possibly due to the shifting of the leads to the
capacitor plates due to the field, rather than anything intrinsic to STO.}
\centering \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/cvb_apl.eps}\label{b_test}
\end{figure}

Of course, in order to perform well for making thermal Hall effect measurements,
these thermometers must not be sensitive to an applied magnetic field.
Figure~\ref{b_test} shows the relative change in capacitance $(C-C_0)/C_0$ of a
sample thermometer measured under a magnetic field from -10 T to 10 T.  The
magnitude of the change in capacitance remains less than 3$\times$10$^{-4}$, a
few parts in ten thousand, below 10 T at 2 K. Compare this to resistive
thermometers, which may have magnetoresistance of a few percent or greater in
this temperature range\cite{Heine1998,Goodrich1998}. We are not sure what the nature
of this small field dependence is, as the dielectric constant should be
independent of applied magnetic field. However, at least some of the change may
be related to the slight shifting of the thermometer leads as the field is
swept.

Another issue concerning the suitability of these thermometers for measuring the
thermal Hall effect, particularly relevant at low temperature, is the heating
caused by the thermometers themselves. As the temperature decreases and the
dielectric constant increases, the dissipative losses from the capacitor
increase as well. These increase to about 60 nW at low temperature. For our
current experiment, which applies 1 mW of power across the sample, this is not a
concern. In general, however, this is not insignificant. 60 nW corresponds to an
excitation of 1 V. Decreasing the excitation will quadratically decrease the
heating power, however this comes at the cost of the sensitivity of the device.
This at least gives us some room to adjust the parameters to fit the particular
experiment. As our process for assembling the thermometers improves, we should
be able to mitigate this source of heat by reducing resistive loss across the
capacitor.  Despite the difficulty with the thermometer heating, the fact that
the thermometers are insensitive to magnetic field at low temperature makes them
good candidates for making a variety of thermal measurements.

Furthermore, the heat loss through the thermometer leads are negligible compared
with the sample's thermal conductance. Each thermometer has a pair of 25 $\mu$m
diameter phosphor bronze leads, with a thermal conductivity of 69.9 $\mathrm{W/m
  \cdot K}$ at room temperature given by the manufacturer (California Fine Wire
  Co)~\cite{CFW}. On the other hand, bismuth has a thermal conductivity of 7.87
  $\mathrm{W/m\cdot K}$ at room temperature~\cite{Ekin2006}.  Given the dimensions
  of our sample and the fact that there are two thermometers with four leads
  total, this results in a thermal conductance of 1.6 $\mathrm{mW/K}$ through
  the sample compared to 0.027 $\mathrm{mW/K}$ through the leads, almost 60
  times smaller. Since the thermal conductivity of bismuth goes up below room
  temperature~\cite{White1958}, while that of phosphor bronze goes
  down~\cite{Ekin2006}, the quality will only improve at the measurement
  temperatures.

\section{Measuring the Thermal Hall Effect in Bismuth}

As a test of these thermometers' suitability for thermal Hall measurements, we
have measured the thermal Hall coefficient of Bismuth metal. Bismuth is one of
the most studied condensed matter systems, being the material in which a host of
physical phenomena were first discovered. Examples include quantum oscillations
and the de Haas van Alphen effect\cite{deHaas1930}, and perhaps more directly
related to the field of thermal transport measurements, the Seebeck
effect\cite{Seebeck1922}. It has a unique electronic structure, being a semimetal
with Dirac-like dispersion\cite{Lui1995, Li2008}, strong spin-orbit
coupling\cite{Yafet1963}, and pronounced diamagnetism\cite{Shoenberg1936}. More
recently, it has been studied\cite{Emoto2016} for its ability to convert spin
current to charge current along with the ferromagnetic insulator
yttrium-iron-garnet through the inverse spin Hall effect and inverse
Rashba-Edelstein effect. This interplay of electronic, magnetic and thermal
phenomena make bismuth a promising candidate for observing the thermal Hall
effect using our capacitive thermometry technique.

The thermal Hall effect on crystalline bismuth has been carried out by W.
Kobayashi \textit{et al.}\cite{Kobayashi2012} down to 75 K and magnetic fields up
to $\pm$3 T. Using our thermometers, we sought to extend this measurement to
lower temperatures and higher fields. A resistive heater was mounted on a single
crystal of bismuth metal, in order to generate a temperature gradient. A pair of
SrTiO$_3$ thermometers were mounted in order to measure the transverse
temperature gradient. The thermometers were glued to the surface of the sample
and then coated in Type 120 silicone thermal joint compound to ensure good
thermal contact with the sample. An example set of temperature gradient data is
shown in Figure~\ref{t_grad}. Two pairs of thermocouples were mounted as well,
one longitudinal and one transverse, in order to independently measure the
temperature gradients \textit{in situ}. An additional resistive thermometer was
mounted nearby to calibrate the SrTiO$_3$ thermometers in zero field.  The
heater was repeatedly turned on and off, and the gradients in each direction
measured. Simultaneously, the applied magnetic field was swept between -10 T and
10 T. This allowed us to measure the field dependence of the thermal Hall
coefficient.

\begin{figure} \caption{Thermal Hall conductivity, computed from the
    transverse temperature difference measured using the STO thermometers from
    -10 T to 10 T. Curves for a few temperatures between 90K and 175K (Panel a)
    and between 40K and 80K (Panel 6). The signal appears to get smaller at
lower temperature, disappearing at 60K.} \centering\label{kappaxy}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/kappaxy_apl.eps} \end{figure}

Similar to what was measured before\cite{Kobayashi2012}, the thermal Hall
conductivity is strongly nonlinear, reaching a maximum below 2 Tesla and
decaying down to zero at high field, as shown in Figure~\ref{kappaxy}.  It is
also largest at high temperature, becoming imperceptible below 50 K, where our
thermometers are most sensitive.  As a result, we are confident that this is not
an artifact of the capacitive thermometers. Thus we can see that the STO
thermometers are able to make sensitive measurements, detecting changes in
temperature below 1 mK in magnetic fields up to 10 T. Additionally, the fact
that they are relatively simple to produce makes them applicable to a wide
variety of measurements and samples. One remaining challenge is our ability to
push these measurements to lower temperature, suitable for use at helium-3 or
dilution refrigerator temperatures, where traditional methods of thermometry are
even more fraught\cite{Heine1998, Goodrich1998}. One promising line of study
involved isotopically substituting $^{18}$O into the strontium titanate wafers,
which has been shown\cite{Rowley2014} to drive them closer to the ferroelectric
quantum phase transition and thus continue the divergence of their dielectric
constant to lower and lower temperature. In any event, as this measurement has
shown, this method of thermometry holds great promise for enabling the thermal
properties of materials in intense magnetic fields.

In conclusion, miniature capacitive thermometers based on the paraelectric
material SrTiO$_3$ have been applied to measure the thermal Hall effect in
crystalline bismuth. A strong nonlinear thermal Hall effect is observed in the
intermediate temperature range. The miniature SrTiO$_3$ thermometers show very
little magnetic field dependence -- less than a factor of 3$\times$10$^{-4}$ up
to magnetic field 10 T. They are also quite sensitive, resolving the temperature
difference as little as 0.1 mK.
